One, two, three
Turn it up

Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think it′s a sin, yes

Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her
Well, I heard old Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I′m coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the governor (boo! Boo! Boo!)
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Here I come, Alabama

(Ah-ah-ah, Alabama)
(Ah-ah-ah, Alabama)
(Ah-ah-ah, Alabama)
(Ah-ah-ah, Alabama)

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two (yes, they do)
Lord, they get me off so much
They pick me up when I′m feeling blue
Now how ′bout you?

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Sweet home Alabama (oh, sweet home, baby)
Where the skies are so blue and the governor′s true
Sweet home Alabama (Lordy)
Lord, I'm coming home to you (yeah, yeah)

Mont-Montgomery′s got the answer
