I′m waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow, and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I′m breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, woah

I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, I'm
Radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, I′m
Radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flag, dye my clothes
It′s a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in, woah

I′m breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, woah

I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, I′m
Radioactive, radioactive
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, I'm
Radioactive, radioactive

All systems go
The sun hasn′t died
Deep in my bones
Straight from inside

I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, I'm
Radioactive, radioactive
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, I′m
Radioactive, radioactive
