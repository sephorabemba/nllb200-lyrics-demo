Yeah

I've been trying to call
I've been alone for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City is cold and empty
Nobody's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
i said, ooh, I'm drowing in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I'm trusting
(Hey, hey, hey)

I am running out of time
because I can see the sunlight up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Nobody's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

i said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
i said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just walking by to let you know (by letting you know)
I can never say it on the phone (I can never say it on the phone)
Never let you go this time

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
(Hey, hey, hey)

(Hey, hey, hey)

i said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
