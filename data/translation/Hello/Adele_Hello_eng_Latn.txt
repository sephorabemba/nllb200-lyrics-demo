Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you would like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal you, but I haven't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must have called a thousand times.
To tell you I'm sorry for everything I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside.
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it doesn't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

- Hi, how are you? - Hi.
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that we both
We're running out of time.

So hello from the other side (the other side)
I must have called a thousand times.
To tell you I'm sorry for everything I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it doesn't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), no more
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), no more
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), no more
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Other (lows, lows, lows, lows)

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must have called a thousand times.
To tell you I'm sorry for everything I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
