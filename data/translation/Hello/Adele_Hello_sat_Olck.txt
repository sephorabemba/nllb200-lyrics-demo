Hello, it's me
I wondered if after all these years you would like to meet
To go over everything

Hello, can you hear me?
I am in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must have called a thousand times
to tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
to tell youI'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it doesn't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Â¿Has ever made it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that we both
